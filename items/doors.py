doors.description = """
The huge double doors are locked and not budging no matter how much pressure
you put on them. They're ornately decorated with three-dimensional patterned wood, and
when you look up at the very top corners, you see two little hooks, almost as if a curtain
used to hang here. To your dismay, you don't see a keyhole anywhere."""
