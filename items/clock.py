clock.description = """
It isn't a grandfather clock, but it isn't much smaller than one. It's working, and is
at least close to the correct time, but it may have slowed down over the years. Unlike most
old clocks you know, this one has three hands rather than just two: an hour hand, a
minute hand and a second hand. As far as you can tell it doesn't have any fancy internal
workings you can pry at, but on the back, right behind the face, you do find three holes,
as narrow as a coat hanger wire."""
