painting.description = """
The painting is of two men standing in this very room, standing proudly with
guns slung over their shoulders. The eyes of one of the men seem to be looking in various
directions, but you've heard of that optical illusion before. The background of the painting
includes most of the room exactly as it is now. The only odd thing is the card table, or
rather, the chairs around it. Two of them are tucked in neatly, but two are spun around
the wrong way, and one of these is tilted back on two legs, leaning against the edge of the
table."""
