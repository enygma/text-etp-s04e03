The safe is, of course, locked, and requires some combination of numbers to open.

You look around for any clues, but don't see anything. You do notice that there's an awful
lot of dust; no one's been anywhere near this safe for ages. And while you look at the dusty
top surface, you suddenly see movement. Some of the dust is peeling away, like a person
is pushing it aside with their finger â€“ only, you don't see a finger. Or a person. The
movement continues, and it becomes clear that the invisible somebody is writing you a
message. H... A... N...G."""
