You have no idea where it's coming from; the clock doesn't have the inner workings to do
this. Plus, what kind of clock gongs at 6:56? It keeps going. Filling the room. Then, another
sound roars above it – a voice.

“You are LATE!”

It shrieks in your ears. You hear a gunshot and feel something zoom past your cheek. Out
of instinct, you drop to the floor, and it's a good thing you do because you hear several
more gunshots, all accompanied by this screaming, raving voice. “LATE! LATE!
LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...”

But before it can finish, it's gone. So are the gunshots, and so is the gong. It's all stopped.
The only sound left is a rattle coming from the inside of the clock, and after a few seconds,
that too subsides. You stand up and look at the clock face. It's frozen. 6:56 and zero
seconds.

You walk towards the doors and find that they now open when you push. Looks like you've
indeed trapped the ghost, and now you're free. Well, you don't need to be told twice. That
said, you take a moment to consider what to do with the possibly-possessed clock; in the
end you pick it up and haul it out with you. Maybe you can burn it just to be safe.
When you reach the front of the manor, you find a person waiting for you. Bill, you presume.
He looks relieved to see you, and remarkably unconcerned about you dragging a huge
antique out of his museum.

“Good job,” he says. “I heard some noises that made me worry you weren't going to make
it. Did I hear gunfire? Who was this ghost?”

You tell him a bit about what you witnessed, and after a moment he nods.

“Ah, Philip. Mr Culloden's hunting instructor. Interesting... we've had his chauffeur, his
chef, and now his hunting teacher. It seems like people who worked for him are the
common denominator. But to have so many ghosts, so many people with unfinished
business, bent on revenge – it seems strange, doesn't it?”

He frowns.
“What went on in this house to leave behind so much hatred?”
